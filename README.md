# polylabel (python port) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stefda/polylabel.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stefda/polylabel)

A fast algorithm for finding polygon pole of inaccessibility, the most distant internal point from the polygon outline (not to be confused with centroid), implemented as a Python library. Useful for optimal placement of a text label on a polygon.
